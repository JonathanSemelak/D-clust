# D-clust (using DADApy)

## Welcome to the D-clust Python Script!  

This code is pretty much an automatization tool that follows the DADApy 
official tutorial, but it makes it easier for AMBER users because amber 
netcdf files can be provided as input directly.

It can extract temporal courses of dihedral angles from your
trajectory file and to analize them with the DADApy library using the 
Advanced Density Peaks algorithm. It also recieves a file with suche
time courses if you prefer so.
