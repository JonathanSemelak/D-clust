# DIHE-clust

## Welcome to the D-clust Python Script!  

This tool will help use to extract temporal courses of dihedral angles from your
trajectory file and to analize them with the DADApy library.       

It's pretty much an automatization tool that follows the DADApy official tutorial,
but it makes it easier for AMBER users.
