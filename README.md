# DIHE-clust

This python code helps to analyze the conformational landscape of a certain molecule by extracting the dihedrals angles obtained from a molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory.

Its purpose is mainly related with automatization of data extraction and data analysis, using other libraries.

It reads .xyz and .netcdf files, and uses sklearn and DADApy to analize the data.
